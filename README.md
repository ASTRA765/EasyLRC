This is a simple script that fetches music lyrics from LRCLIB and creates an LRC file with them.

You can execute it directly from the terminal using the following syntax:
### PowerShell
``` PowerShell
.\lrc.exe Name of the song
```

It works also without compile if you have python installed:
### Python | Powershell or SHELL
``` BASH
python ./lrc.py Name of the song
```

The script will search for the lyrics of the song on https://lrclib.net and create an LRC file in the same folder where you run the script.

I know it's not perfect, but this tool is something I've been looking for a long time, and I just wanted to share it.
